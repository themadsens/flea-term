# FLEA-term
A wxLua terminal emulator

A cross platform terminal emulation based on luajit and wxLua 
The underlying wx widget is wxAuiNotebook for flexible pane placement
Some of the code is lifted from the estrela editor as it uses the same approach
The executing platform is more or less lifted from ZeroBrane studio

FLEA-term could be short for Flemmings Lua Execution Apparatus for a Terminal Emulation Rendering Machine ..
